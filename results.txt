 Conclusions:
     As must be the case, the house always wins.
     More specifically though:
        The biggest factor is naturally the fact that the player has to go first.
        But after that: Treating aces as high until forced to drop them effects a ~2% swing. Soft seems to always play worse.
        The exact number you stop on doesn't make much difference, although a hard 15 seems to be the best.
        The strategic player I wrote, does 1% better than a blind hard-15 bot. Fascinating.
        Also a little surprising: Drawing to 12 isn't all that terrible a strategy as a player, but it's absolutely awful as a dealer.

    I expected the house to always have an edge, at least with the basic strategy I have (and, I should assume, with any strategy excluding card-counting), but the strategies I thought would have a significant impact, don't, and a few that I expected would have only nominal impact (like hard19 vs hard16-18) actually have a huge (negative) effect.
